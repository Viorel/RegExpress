HOW IT'S MADE
-------------

- Get the release from "https://github.com/laurikari/tre/releases". Use the "Source code (.zip)".

- Copy the needed folders, such as:

    ~ lib
    ~ local_includes
    ~ win32 (including the "tre.vcxproj" project; the ".slnx" and other ".vcxproj" are not needed)

- Open the "tre.vcxproj" project in Visual Studio.

- Open the Project Properties:

    ~ add the "x64" platform
    ~ remove the "Win32" and "x86" platforms
    ~ change C/C++, Code Generation, Runtime Library to "Multi-threaded Debug (/MTd)" for Debug configuration
    ~ change C/C++, Code Generation, Runtime Library to "Multi-threaded (/MT)" for Release configuration
    ~ in C/C++, Preprocessor, remove the "TRE_DEBUG" definition
    ~ The General, Intermediate Directory was changed to "obj\$(Configuration)\$(Platform)\"
    ~ The General, Output Directory was changed to "bin\$(Configuration)\$(Platform)\"
    ~ The Linker, Output File was changed to "$(OutDir)$(TargetName)$(TargetExt)"
    ~ Other output-related options that contained ".\debug" was changed to default ones (from new similar DLL projects)

- Compile. No errors should be produced. Some warnings appear.

- Save and close the project. The solution file that is asked by Visual Studio can be saved to this folder, 
  but the project is also added to main solution.
