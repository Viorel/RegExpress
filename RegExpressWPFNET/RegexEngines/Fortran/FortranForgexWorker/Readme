To recompile this engine:

- Install the "Intel® Fortran Compiler", including the extension for Visual Studio.
- Load and recompile the solution (.sln) in Visual Studio, using "Release, x64" configuration.
- Commit the changes to Git, including the "x64\Release\FortranForgexWorker.exe" file.

To update the code:

- Get the last release from "https://github.com/ShinobuAmasaki/forgex".
- Add the new files, from "src" subfolder, to "Forgex-min\src" subfolder:
    ~ the old files, which are not present in new release, must be removed from disk and from Visual Studio project
      (or just delete all files before copying new ones),
    ~ the "CMakeLists.txt" files must not be copied,
    ~ the test files (e.g. "test_m.f90") must not be copied,
    ~ the new files must be added to Visual Studio project (to "Forgex" folder in Solution Explorer).

Note. This project must not be added to main solution because the extension is not necessary present in Visual Studio.
