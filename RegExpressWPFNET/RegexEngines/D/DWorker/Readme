In order to rebuild DWorker:

- Download and install 'DMD' compiler for Windows from https://dlang.org/download.html. (Uninstall the older compiler).
  Or download and uncompress the archive, without installation.

- Run 'build.cmd'. It will make the 'DWorker.exe' file. 
  (In case of downloaded DMD without installation, edit the 'build.cmd' 
  and adjust the path to 'dmd' compiler).

- Rebuild ("Rebuild All") the Visual Studio solution. A Custom build step 
  will copy 'DWorker.exe' to output folder as 'DWorker.bin'.

- Commit and push the changes to Git (including 'DWorker.exe').
