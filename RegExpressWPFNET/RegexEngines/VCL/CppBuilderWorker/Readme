HOW IT'S MADE
-----------------

- Install the C++ Builder Community.

- Start the C++ Builder; load the project: "CppBuilderWorker.cbproj".

- Edit the code, if required.

- Make sure that the current configuration is "Release", "Win64".

- Rebuild the project. It will generate the "Win64\Release\CppBuilderWorker.exe" file.

- Commit the changed files, including "CppBuilderWorker.exe".
