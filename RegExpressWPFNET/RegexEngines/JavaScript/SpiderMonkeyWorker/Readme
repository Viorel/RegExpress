HOW TO PREPARE THE RUNTIME

- Install Node.js, or download standalone binaries. (In case of standaline binaries, 
  the commands bellow should be adjusted to include paths).

- Install "jsvu" from https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/jsvu:

    npm install jsvu -g

- Run jsvu, select "SpiderMonkey" when it asks. The engine will be installed to "C:\Users\<USER>\.jsvu\engines\spidermonkey".

- Archive the "spidermonkey" folder to "spidermonkey.zip" uzing ZIP format, ultra level, Deflate or Deflate64 method.
  (for example: "7z.exe a -tzip -mx9 -mm=deflate64 spidermonkey.zip spidermonkey").

- Commit the "spidermonkey.zip" file.
