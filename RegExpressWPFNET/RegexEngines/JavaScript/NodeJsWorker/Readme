HOW TO PREPARE THE WORKER

- Install Node.js, or download standalone binaries. (In case of standaline binaries, 
  the ".cmd" files bellow should be adjusted to include paths).

- Edit "NodeJsWorker.js" if required.

- Execute "build.cmd" from command line console. It will create the "NodeJsWorker.exe" file.

- Compress the "NodeJsWorker.exe" file to "NodeJsWorker.zip" uzing ZIP format, ultra level, 
  Deflate or Deflate64 method. Or execute the "compress.cmd".

- To test, execute "test1.cmd" and "test2.cmd".

- Commit the changed files (such as "NodeJsWorker.js", "NodeJsWorker.zip"). The "NodeJsWorker.exe" is not needed.
