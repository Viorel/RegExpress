HOW IT'S MADE
-------------


- Install MSYS2 according to https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw. 

    In short:
        - install MSYS2
        - install toolchain
        - Modify PATH
        - restart consoles

- Check g++ and gcc in console:

    > g++ --version    
    > gcc --version

- Build:

    > build.cmd

    It will create the "GccWorker.exe". To check it, execute, for example:

    > GccWorker.exe < testinput2.txt

- Commit and push "GccWorker.exe" to Git.


Note. It is also possible to use Visual Studio Code.
