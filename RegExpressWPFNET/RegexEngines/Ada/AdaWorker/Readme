- Install MSYS2 according to https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw. 

    In short:
        - install MSYS2
        - install toolchain (NOTE. We are using UCRT, not MINGW environment)
        - Modify PATH
        - restart consoles

    This is also required for GCC C++.

- Install Ada to MSYS2

    > pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gnatcoll-core

- Install gprbuild

    > pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gprbuild

- Build

    > build.cmd

    It will create "adaworker.exe"

- Commit and push "adaworker.exe" to Git.
