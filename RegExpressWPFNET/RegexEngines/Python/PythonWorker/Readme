To install the "regex" package into embeddable Python:

   - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49737721/adding-packages-to-python-embedded-installation-for-windows.

(Use "regex" instead of "numpy")

Summary:

- edit "python311._pth", uncomment "import site" (keep it incommented)

- run "powershell", enter "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -OutFile get-pip.py", 
  enter "exit" to quit PowerShell

- run "python get-pip.py"

- run ".\Scripts\pip install regex"

- the unneeded "pip", which includes a lot of files, can be uninstalled using "python -m pip uninstall pip setuptools";
  use "python get-pip.py" if it is needed again
