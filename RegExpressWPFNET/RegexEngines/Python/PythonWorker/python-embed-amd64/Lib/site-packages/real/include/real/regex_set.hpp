/*!
 * \file regex_set.hpp
 * \brief `real::regex_set` — multi-pattern which-matched set.
 *
 * Which-matched semantics (RE2::Set / rust `RegexSet`): which members match the
 * subject at least once. **Not** \ref real::dfa munch (one winner at the cursor).
 *
 * Two search shapes. When enough patterns are DFA-eligible, a fused unanchored multi-accept DFA
 * (`dfa_mode::which_matched`) scans once for all of them: built at construction for a large set, or once a
 * mid-sized set has walked enough text to pay for it. Ineligible patterns (lookaround, a wide code-point
 * class such as text-mode \\w, …) and small sets walk one pattern at a time through `regex::search`. The
 * public bitset is always in **construction order**; fused rule indices are remapped.
 *
 * Include this header explicitly; \c real.hpp does not pull it in.

     * Zero work per call is the constraint: classifying per query charges every call, including an any-match
     * walk whose first member hits at once. Everything happens here, once; the walks test one bit.
     *
     * The classification is the engine's own: `first_bytes_valid` plus `single_first` or a `small_set_size`
     * of 2..8. The hint builder sets `small_set` only when all 256 bytes of `first_bytes` count 2..8, so the
     * array is the COMPLETE leading set, which is what makes skipping a member sound. A nullable pattern
     * has `first_bytes_valid` false and stays wide.
     *
     * The union is capped in construction order (narrowest-first reorders which members are served, for no
     * gain), so several sparse members cannot form a dense union. A wide member never joins: one
     * `\w`-leading pattern costs the others nothing.
