In order to rebuild the RustRegressWorker ("src\main.rs"):

- Download and install "Rust" from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install. 
  Use the recommended "rustup". Select the 64-bit installer.

  It will include the Rust compiler and Cargo package manager. 
  To check, run from command line:

        rustc --version
        cargo --version

- If required, adjust the versions in "Cargo.toml" file, "[dependencies]" section.

- Run this command:

        cargo build --release

  It will generate the "target\release\RustRegressWorker.exe".

- Rebuild ("Rebuild All") the Visual Studio solution. A Custom build step 
  will copy 'RustRegressWorker.exe' to output folder as 'RustRegressWorker.bin'.

- Commit and push the changes to Git (including 'RustRegressWorker.exe').
