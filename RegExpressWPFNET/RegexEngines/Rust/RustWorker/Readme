In order to rebuild the RustWorker ("src\main.rs"):

- Download and install "Rust" from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install. 
  Use the recommended "rustup". Select the 64-bit installer.

  It will include the Rust compiler and Cargo package manager. 
  To check, run from command line:

        rustc --version
        cargo --version

- Run this command:

        cargo build --release

  It will generate "target\release\RustWorker.exe"

- Rebuild ("Rebuild All") the main Visual Studio solution. A Custom build step 
  will copy 'RustWorker.exe' to output folder as 'RustWorker.bin'.

- Commit and push the changes to Git (including 'RustWorker.exe').
