HOW IT'S MADE
------------------------

- Install the Qt (Free Community edition)
  
  NOTE. During installation, select "Custom", and specify "MSVC" (not just "MINGW", or instead of).

- In Visual Studio, install the "Qt Visual Studio Tools" extension.

  It will ask to configure the Qt version by selecting the folder with previously installed Qt.

- In Visual Studio, load the "QtWorker.sln" solution. If required, edit the code.

- Build the "Release", "x64" configuration. 

  It will generate the next files in "x64\Release":
    
    - "Qt6Core.dll"
    - "QtWorker.exe"

- Commit the "Qt6Core.dll" and "QtWorker.exe" files.
