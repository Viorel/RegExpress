TYPICAL UPDATE PROCEDURE
------------------------

- Get the PCRE2 sources from GitHub (from Releases page, https://github.com/PCRE2Project/pcre2/releases) 
  to a separate folder.

- Copy from "<PCRE2-git-folder>\src" to "PCRE2StaticLib\PCRE2\src".
  The existing old files should be removed before copying new files.

- Copy from "<PCRE2-git-folder>\deps\sljit" to "PCRE2StaticLib\PCRE2\deps\sljit". 
  The existing old files should be removed before copying new files.

- Delete the unneeded copied "*.in" files.

- Delete the unneeded copied ".c" files that contain the "main(" function.

- Rename "config.h.generic" to "config.h".

- Rename "pcre2.h.generic" to "pcre2.h".

- Rename "pcre2_chartables.c.dist" to "pcre2_chartables.c".

- Remove and re-add all copied "*.c" files to "PCRE2 Sources" filter in Visual Studio.
  The files from "deps\sljit" do not have to be added.

- Select all ".c" files, go to Properties, for all configurations, set:

    Advanced, Forced Include File: "$(ProjectDir)ForcedInclude.h"

- Some of the ".c" files must be excluded from build, in Properties dialog, such as:

    "pcre2_jit_match.c"
    "pcre2_jit_misc.c"
    "pcre2_printint.c"
    "pcre2_ucptables.c"

    (It seems that these files are not more present in PCRE2 10.47).
